# definitely-not-boxhead

Definitely-Not-Boxhead is a zombie survival game loosely based on Boxhead2Play. 
It was written to run on a Keil ARM Cortex-M3 Microcontroller. The user uses a joystick
to move and a button to shoot. There are 8 LEDs on the board to display how much health the
player has remaining.
